This project contains many different files and code which showcase my learning process throughout this project. All files contain comments at the top of the code to show the goal and function of the specific file. This is to assist in understanding the learning processes I went through and what I was trying to complete. However, some of the more important files which really showcase some of my success in this project are Scala's parallelScaperWithData, booksToScrapeSequential, AllSolutionsSequential, AllSolutionsParallel, and pythons realtyAutoScraper.py, phuketScraper.py, and proxy.py. 

Important Project note. This project makes use of both Scala and Python. All files are contained within the repository, but the python code is within PythonScraper file folder and the Scala code is located in the 
src/main/scala file folder. 

Note that occasionally Selenium Web Driver will just fail to run. In this case rerun the code. 


For the Python code, I've made a python virtual environment. This should make it easier to run the code because requirements for library downloads and packages are specified in the requirements.txt. 
I also tried to code everything in python such that the least amount of packages will be needed for it to be run on another Computer. After cloning the repo, I think all you should need to do is activate the python
Virtual environment. This can be done in the terminal by navigating to the project directory and typing 
"$ .\venv\Scripts\activate" to activate in windows and "$ source venv/bin/activate" if you are on Mac. Afterwards, install the requirements for the project with pip and the following command: 
"$pip install -r requirements.txt"
