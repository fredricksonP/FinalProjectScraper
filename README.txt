This project contains many different files and code which showcase my learning process throughout this project. All files contain comments at the top of the code to show the goal and function of the specific file. This is to assist in understanding the learning processes I went through and what I was trying to complete. However, some of the more important files which really showcase some of my success in this project are Scala's parallelScaperWithData, booksToScrapeSequential, AllSolutionsSequential, AllSolutionsParallel, and pythons realtyAutoScraper.py, phuketScraper.py, and proxy.py. 

Important Project note. This project makes use of both Scala and Python. All files are contained within the repository, but the python code is within PythonScraper file folder and the Scala code is located in the 
src/main/scala file folder. 

Note that occasionally Selenium Web Driver will just fail to run. In this case rerun the code. 


To run this code, you will need selenium downloaded on your computer.
Also, you will need the latest version of chrome 126.0.6478.115 and you will need to properly download
the chrome web driver for the selenium automation to work.
